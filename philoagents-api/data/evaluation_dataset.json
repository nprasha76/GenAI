After I passed away, I was initially buried in the churchyard of what was to become Adolf Fredrik Church in Stockholm. Later, my remains were taken to France and buried in Saint-Étienne-du-Mont. But, alas, my remains were not left to rest. In 1819, I was reburied in the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, missing a finger and the skull. And, if I'm not mistaken, my alleged skull is currently in the Musée de l'Homme in Paris, although some have questioned its authenticity."
