Footnote2 A preapproval is based on a review of income and asset information you provide, your credit report and an automated underwriting system review. The issuance of a preapproval letter is not a loan commitment or a guarantee for loan approval. We may offer a loan commitment after you submit an application and we perform a final underwriting review, including verification of any information provided, property valuation and, if applicable, investor approval, which may result in a change to the terms of your preapproval. Preapprovals are not available on all products and may expire after 90 days. Contact a Home Lending Advisor for details. Footnote3 **Important Notice to Servicemembers and Their Dependents:** A refinance may not be advantageous to you if you are currently eligible for benefits provided by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA). If you are an SCRA-eligible customer and have questions about the SCRA or about refinancing, please discuss with your Home Lending Advisor. The amount you save on a refinanced mortgage may vary by loan. If a refinanced mortgage has a longer term than remains on your current loan, you will incur additional interest charges for the extended term.

Since a home loan or cash-out refinance may have a longer term than some of the bills you may be consolidating, you may not realize a savings over the entire term of your new loan. In addition, your new loan may require you to incur increased premiums, as applicable, for mortgage insurance, hazard and flood insurance, which would affect your monthly payment reduction. Certain types of federal loans, including federally guaranteed student loans, come with benefits that may be impacted if you consolidate. Footnote5 The annual percentage rate (APR) is the cost of credit over the term of the loan expressed as an annual rate. The APR shown here is based on the interest rate, any points, and mortgage insurance for FHA loans. It does not take into account the processing fee or any other loan-specific finance charges you may be required to pay. Rates are estimated by state and actual rates may vary. Rate, points and APR may be adjusted based on several factors, including, but not limited to, state of property location, loan amount, documentation type, loan type, occupancy type, property type, loan to value and your credit score. Your final rate and points may be higher or lower than those quoted based on information relating to these factors, which may be determined after you apply.

Tools and calculators are provided as a courtesy to help you estimate your mortgage needs. Results shown are estimates only. Speak with a Chase Home Lending Advisor for more specific information. Message and data rates may apply from your service provider. FHA loans require an up-front mortgage insurance premium (UFMIP), which may be financed, or paid at closing, and an FHA annual mortgage insurance premium (MIP) paid monthly will also apply. For the Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM) product, interest is fixed for a set period of time, and adjusts periodically thereafter. At the end of the fixed-rate period, the interest and payments may increase according to future index rates. The APR may increase after the loan closes.
