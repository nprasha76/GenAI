# Contributing to the PhiloAgents Course

Welcome to one of the most comprehensive open-source courses on Agents üëã

We deeply appreciate your support for the AI community and future readers ü§ó

## Ways to Contribute

The course itself is already a comprehensive end-to-end resource.

But as a community project, we weren't able to test the code on all possible scenarios. 

Thus, if you find any bugs or improvements, consider supporting future readers by contributing to this course.

A contribution can be:
- Fixing typos
- Updating version numbers
- Fixing fundamental issues, such as Python modules that don't work anymore
- Clarification in documentation
- Support for different operating systems (e.g., Windows)

Remember, no contribution is too small. Every improvement helps make this repository an even better resource for the community.
